Maintainability:
Split the app.py into multiple modules based on functionality (e.g., database operations, route handling, socket communication) to improve maintainability
Remove redundancies such as database connection setups and error handling mechanisms
Move configurations configuration files instead of being hard-coded

Scalability:
Partition convergence data to make it more scalable if there are many large simulations
Implement connection pooling to make database connections more efficient under load
Load-balancing and caching
Add database indexes to optimize queries
Implement asynchronous task handling (e.g., using Celery) for background tasks like updating convergence data.

Security:
Improve database connection protocol
Input validation (SQL injection)
HTTPS

Deployment:
Separate the test database from production database
Improve test suite and add performance tests
Implement logging and monitoring (Health-checks)

Improve documentation
